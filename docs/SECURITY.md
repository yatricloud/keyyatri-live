# Security Documentation

## Overview

KeyYatri implements multiple layers of security to protect user data:

1. Authentication
2. Encryption
3. Row Level Security (RLS)
4. Secure Communication

## Authentication

### User Authentication
- Email/password authentication via Supabase
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 6 characters
  - Case sensitive
  - Special characters allowed

### Master Key
- Secondary layer of security
- Required for encrypting/decrypting credentials
- Never stored in plain text
- Cannot be recovered if lost

## Encryption

### Password Encryption
- AES encryption for all stored passwords
- Client-side encryption/decryption
- Master key used as encryption key
- Unique IV for each encryption

### Master Key Storage
- Encrypted before storage
- Uses a separate encryption key
- Stored in a separate table
- Protected by RLS policies

## Data Protection

### Row Level Security
- Enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Policies enforce data isolation
- No direct database access

### API Security
- HTTPS only
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. Use a strong master key
2. Never share the master key
3. Use unique passwords
4. Enable 2FA when available
5. Regular password updates

### For Developers
1. Never log sensitive data
2. Use parameterized queries
3. Validate all inputs
4. Regular security audits
5. Keep dependencies updated

## Incident Response

### Security Breaches
1. Immediate password reset
2. User notification
3. Incident investigation
4. Security patch deployment
5. Post-mortem analysis

### Data Recovery
1. Master key is non-recoverable
2. Users must maintain their own backups
3. Support for credential export
4. Emergency access procedures

## Compliance

### Data Privacy
- GDPR compliant
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- User consent required

### Data Handling
- Encrypted storage
- Secure transmission
- Regular audits
- Access logging
