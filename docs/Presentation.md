# Presentation on KeyYatri Password Manager

## Introduction
* Overview of KeyYatri Password Manager
* Technologies used: React, Node.js, Supabase, and Azure

## Node.js
* Introduction to Node.js
  Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to build scalable network applications using JavaScript on the server-side.

* Installation steps
  To install Node.js, follow these steps:
  1. Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
  2. Download the installer for your operating system.
  3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
  To verify the installation, open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
  This should display the installed Node.js version.

* Key features and benefits
  Node.js has a built-in module system. Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported and used in other files.

* Example usage in KeyYatri Password Manager
  The event loop is a core concept in Node.js. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

* Best practices and common pitfalls
  - Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
  - Handle errors properly using try/catch or promise catch blocks.
  - Use async/await for better readability.
  - Modularize your code for better maintainability.
  - Use environment variables for configuration.
  - Blocking the event loop with synchronous code.
  - Not handling errors properly.
  - Using outdated or insecure packages.
  - Hardcoding configuration values.

## Supabase
* Introduction to Supabase
  Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of tools for building and managing applications. It offers features such as authentication, database management, and real-time subscriptions.

* Setting up a Supabase project
  To get started with Supabase, follow these steps:
  1. **Create a Supabase account**: Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) and sign up for an account.
  2. **Create a new project**: Once you have an account, create a new project in the Supabase dashboard.
  3. **Get your API keys**: In the project settings, you will find your `Supabase URL` and `Supabase Anon Key`. These will be used to connect your application to Supabase.

* Authentication with Supabase
  Supabase provides built-in authentication with various providers such as email/password, OAuth, and more. Here's how to set up email/password authentication:
  1. **Enable email/password authentication**: In the Supabase dashboard, go to the Authentication section and enable email/password authentication.
  2. **Sign up users**: Use the Supabase client to sign up users with their email and password.
  ```javascript
  import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

  const supabaseUrl = 'your-supabase-url';
  const supabaseKey = 'your-supabase-anon-key';
  const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

  const signUp = async (email, password) => {
    const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
      email,
      password,
    });
    if (error) console.error('Error signing up:', error);
    else console.log('User signed up:', user);
  };
  ```
  3. **Sign in users**: Use the Supabase client to sign in users with their email and password.
  ```javascript
  const signIn = async (email, password) => {
    const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email,
      password,
    });
    if (error) console.error('Error signing in:', error);
    else console.log('User signed in:', user);
  };
  ```

* Database management with Supabase
  Supabase uses PostgreSQL as its database. You can manage your database using SQL queries or the Supabase dashboard.

* Example usage in KeyYatri Password Manager
  To create a table in your Supabase database, you can use SQL queries. For example, to create a `users` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```

* Best practices and common pitfalls
  - **Use environment variables**: Store your Supabase URL and API keys in environment variables to keep them secure.
  - **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)**: Use RLS to control access to your data at the row level.
  - **Use policies**: Create policies to define who can access and modify your data.
  - **Not enabling RLS**: Without RLS, your data may be accessible to unauthorized users.
  - **Hardcoding API keys**: Avoid hardcoding your API keys in your code. Use environment variables instead.

## Azure
* Introduction to Azure
  Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

* Key services used in KeyYatri Password Manager
  - Azure App Service: Used to host the KeyYatri web application.
  - Azure SQL Database: Used to store user credentials securely.
  - Azure Key Vault: Used to manage and secure sensitive information such as API keys and database connection strings.

* Setting up Azure services
  1. **Create an Azure account**: Go to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and sign up for an account.
  2. **Create a new resource group**: In the Azure portal, create a new resource group to organize your resources.
  3. **Create an App Service**: Create a new App Service to host your web application.
  4. **Create a SQL Database**: Create a new SQL Database to store your data.
  5. **Create a Key Vault**: Create a new Key Vault to manage your secrets.

* Example usage in KeyYatri Password Manager
  - Deploying the KeyYatri web application to Azure App Service.
  - Storing user credentials in Azure SQL Database.
  - Managing API keys and connection strings in Azure Key Vault.

* Best practices and common pitfalls
  - **Use managed services**: Leverage Azure's managed services to reduce operational overhead.
  - **Implement security best practices**: Use Azure Key Vault to manage secrets, enable encryption, and implement access controls.
  - **Monitor and optimize**: Use Azure Monitor to track performance and optimize resource usage.
  - **Not using managed services**: Managing infrastructure manually can lead to increased complexity and operational overhead.
  - **Ignoring security best practices**: Failing to secure sensitive information can lead to data breaches.
  - **Neglecting monitoring**: Without proper monitoring, issues may go unnoticed and impact application performance.
